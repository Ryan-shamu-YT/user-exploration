# Errors and questions
Q: My anti-virus detected it as a virus!
A: Yes, we know that because the file makes requests and is originally in Python so it looks suspicious to antiviruses. We don't have any viruses in our app!

Q: Windows said this is a dangerous app!
A: It will because to make a certificate to exe app cost $400 per month!

Q: Nothing happens when I launch!
A: Make sure you are using Windows 8,10 or 11, you must have internet access and check if your anti-virus is triggered on the app.

Q: Why can't you just host yourself?
A: Well currently I'm searching for hosts where I can put my code. Maybe soon I will buy a device that will host code for me.

Q: How to stop it?
A: Just close the app window.
