# Errors and questions
### Q. My anti-virus detected it as a virus!
A. Yes, we know that because the file makes requests and is originally in Python so it looks suspicious to antiviruses. We don't have any viruses in our app!

### Q. Windows said this is a dangerous app!
A. It will because to make a certificate to the exe app costs $400 per month!

### Q. Nothing happens when I launch!
A. Make sure you are using Windows 8,10 or 11, you must have internet access and check if your anti-virus is triggered on the app.

### Q. Why can't you just host yourself?
A. Well currently I'm searching for hosts where I can put my code. Maybe soon I will buy a device that will host code for me.

### Q. How to stop it?
A. Just close the app window.
